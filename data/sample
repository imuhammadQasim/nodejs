Summary
We are looking to hire a skilled developer to create a complete Employee Screen Monitoring System, consisting of:

A native desktop application (installable on employee PCs), and

An admin dashboard web app to monitor screens in real-time.

👨‍💻 Employee Side (Desktop App):
A native desktop app (Windows preferred, cross-platform is a plus)

Simple login form with ID and Password

After login, the app should automatically start sharing the full screen to the admin dashboard

No manual permission popup each time — it should start immediately after login (since it’s a native app)

Continuous screen sharing (unlimited duration) until logout or app closed

Optionally auto-start on system boot

🧑‍💼 Admin Side (Web Dashboard):
A secure web-based dashboard accessible via browser (built using Node.js + socket.io + HTML/CSS/Bootstrap)

Admin can see a list of all online employees

For each employee, the admin can view their screen live in real-time

Layout should support multiple streams (e.g., grid view)

Show basic info like employee ID, status (active/inactive), connection time

Admin dashboard should update live without refreshing

🔐 Security & Technical Notes:
Secure authentication between employee app and server

Efficient and optimized real-time screen streaming (WebRTC / socket.io)

Server should be hostable on any standard VPS (Node.js-based)

No third-party paid APIs; open-source or native implementation preferred

Code must be clean, modular, and well-commented
